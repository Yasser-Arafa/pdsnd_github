### Project Title
U.S Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, we will use data provided by a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. And we will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. So we will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics like Popular times of travel, Popular stations and trip, Trip duration, and User info.

### Files used
bikeshare_2.py
